# BHA_Spectrophotometer

Photodiode-based spectrophotometer using the TSL1402R IC.

No design changes were made to this project. It is possible to get photodiode arrays from common document scanners (see pics), but we've had trouble finding the documentation for those components, and chose instead to use the TSL1402R IC.

As of 05.2015, the spectrophotometer still isn't fully working, probably some code issues.

Documentation can be found [here](http://biohackacademy.github.io/biofactory/class/7-spectrometer/)
